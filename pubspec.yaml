# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
# To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
# assets:
#   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
#   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
#
# For details regarding assets in packages, see
# https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
#
# An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
# https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

# To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
# in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
# "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
# list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
# example:
# fonts:
#   - family: Schyler
#     fonts:
#       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
#       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
#         style: italic
#   - family: Trajan Pro
#     fonts:
#       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
#       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
#         weight: 700
#
# For details regarding fonts in packages, see
# https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
